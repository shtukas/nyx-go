    Nx19
    {
        "announce" : String
        "type"     : "NxListing"
        "payload"  : NxListing
    }
    {
        "announce" : String
        "type"     : "Nx27"
        "payload"  : Nx27
    }
    {
        "announce" : String
        "type"     : "GalaxyLocation"
        "payload"  : String, FS Location
    }

Go
    type Nx19 struct {
        announce string
        uuid     string
    }

The reason why there is a difference in the Ruby version and the Go version is that the Ruby version is essentially a JSON object. I would have given the same shape to the Go version if Go had nice support for union types.
